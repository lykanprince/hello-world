Hey peeps!

I am new in the programming world! I graduated from college in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in English, concentration in Creative Writing. I took a six-month computer repair course in 2014 and I built my first computer in July 2015. I have played around both Windows and Mac OSX Desktops so I know my way around their operating systems and main programs. What's funny is that I played with computers all of my life but not once did I ever think to program! I want to develop video games and design websites. I also want to learn how to program in HTML, Javascript and C#/C++. I cannot wait to show my creations to all of you! This will be quite an adventure!
